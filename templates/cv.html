                &nbsp;About Me
            </span>

    </div>
    <p>
        An experienced engineer with extensive industrial experience working in a global organisation, with a passion for continuous learning and development, both at work and in my personal life. 
        Achieving a First Class MEng from Imperial College London has been a highlight of my career, and is testament to my determination and ability to achieve my goals. 
        I enjoy solving difficult problems and relish in challenges that require strong analytical thinking to arrive at a solution - but I am not one to believe there's only ever one solution to a problem.
    </p>
    <p>
        Having been interested in computers from as early as I can remember, I am keen to build on my interest and evolve into a professional software engineer/developer. 
        To date, I am self-taught but, a recent job move has afforded me more opportunities to put my programming knowledge to test, and I have proven myself a pivotal member of the team in a short period of time.

    <h4>BAE Systems</h4>
    <h5>Structural Data Engineer, 2021 - present</h5>
    <ul>
        <li>Current role, involves analysing aircraft structural data to provide our customers insights into the life of
            their fleet, and act as a support to ensure the aircraft achieve their designed life.</li>
        <li>
            I have developed an expertise in MATLAB within my team, and use my skills to develop new scripts and
            programs that have helped automate various processes, such as highlighting trends in the data and writing
            these into a report.
            This task that would previously require a number of hours to fiddle through numerous tables and slides now
            runs in less than second each time a customer report is required.
        </li>
        <li>
            My passion for Software Development and Engineering has me always thinking about Continuous  Improvement (CI)
            within the team, and as such I contribute heavily towards the team's CI objectives for the year.
            Whether it be a MATLAB related automation improvement that reduces cost, or streamlining the integration
            between other teams that make everyone's job that bit easier, I enjoy making a notable contribution to the
            team.

        <li>I enjoy a lot of outdoor sports, specifically anything to do with the mountains, such as hiking, mountaineering and rock climbing.</li>
        <li>I ignited a passion for running during the pandemic, running my first half-marathon within a couple of months. My aim is to run a marathon in the future once I can get back to training!</li>
        <li>Indoors, I spend a lot of time bouldering, with the aim of taking these skills to the outdoors. I also play badminton with my significant as often as we can.</li>
        <li>Other sports that interest me are rugby and rowing, which I completed in for Imperial College London during my university days.</li>
        <li>Away from sports, I enjoy travelling, exploring new places and immersing myself in new cultures, all to expand my horizons and learn more about the world.</li>
        <li>Additionally, I have interest in photography, which appeals to my creative side and allows me to capture how I see the world.</li>
